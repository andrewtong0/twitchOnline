# twitchOnline
Check if streamers from a list of specified streamers go live on Twitch

## Dependencies
* Requests (for making calls to the New Twitch API)
* Regular Expressions (for parsing and cleaning received data)
* SlackClient (Slack API for notifications + commands)
* Time (Delays between subsequent calls)

## What Does it Do
twitchOnline monitors a list of Twitch streamers that you input and sends a message in a designated Slack channel when one of them goes live. Also provides command functionality for more flexibility. If you're curious regarding the process in which I developed this script, you can check out my blog post [here](https://thecompanyproject.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/tol-online-broadcast-bot/).

## Necessary Input
In order to make the code work, you must modify the following in the code:
* Input Twitch Client ID (guide on how to find yours [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/chatplay-generate-twitch-client-id.html))
* Slack Token (search it up, pretty easy to find)
* Streams to check (alter "users" variable with a list of strings as stream names, names should be lowercase)
* Slack Channel to send messages to

## Commands
* .online - gives a list of all online streams (from given list of streams to check for).
* .streams - gives a full list of streams being monitored.
* .help - gives a list of all available commands (hard coded in).
* .status STREAMNAME - replace STREAMNAME with a stream name (case sensitive to given stream list) to check the current status of the stream (online/offline). Also provides a link to the stream.

## Important Notes
* The New Twitch API handles capitalization of names in cURL requests weird. I've found that keeping stream usernames in the list of names to check for in all lowercase works.
* The New Twitch API has delays in being refreshed. As such, notifications are not immediate and from my experience, take up to 3 minutes for changes to be pushed to live.
* The .status command is case sensitive and must be matched to the capitalization input in the 'users' variable
* New Twitch API can only handle a maximum of 100 users in a cURL request. If you require more than 100 users, make a second request with the additional users.

## Nonexistent Roadmap
No guarantees I'll ever get to these since I usually abandon projects once they're done (or sometimes when they aren't done).
* Discord API integration (rather than Slack)
* Remove case sensitivity in commands and user input
